Run an Agent with URL and Calculator tools available for its use. 
The Agent decides which tool to use to solve a problem.
## Quick start

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the Agent.
2. Open the Playground and chat with the Agent. Request some information about a recipe, and then ask to add two numbers together. In the responses, the Agent will use different tools to solve different problems.
